The fonts in this directory should be automatically loaded by the LightDJ
software as needed. If that doesn't work though, you should be able to install
the fonts on the system and have them work that way as well. For example, if
you're running Ubuntu, you can add these files to the .fonts directory in your
home directory.

Cheers!
